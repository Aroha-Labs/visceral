Based on analyzing these thumbnail images, here are the key trends I observe in the composition and positioning of elements:
 
1. Text placement:
- Large, bold text is often centered or placed in the top half of the image
- Game modes or key features are prominently displayed (e.g. "SOLO SCRIMS", "ZONE WARS")
- "NEW!" tags are frequently used, often in the top corners
 
2. Character/object positioning:
- Main characters or mascots are typically centered or slightly off-center
- Weapons and items are often arranged around the edges or corners
- Characters are usually facing forward or in action poses
 
3. Background:
- Colorful, vibrant backgrounds are common
- Game environments or stylized landscapes are frequently used
- Gradients and simple color schemes are also popular
 
4. Layout:
- Symmetrical or near-symmetrical compositions are prevalent
- Visual elements are often arranged in a grid-like or circular pattern
- The center of the image is usually the focal point
 
5. Branding:
- Game logos or titles are prominently displayed, usually in large text
- Consistent color schemes and visual styles are maintained across related thumbnails
 
6. Visual effects:
- Glowing effects, sparkles, or starbursts are commonly used to highlight items
- Drop shadows and outlines are applied to make text and objects stand out
 
7. Content showcase:
- New weapons, characters, or game features are often highlighted
- Multiple elements are typically included to show variety in gameplay
 
These design choices aim to create eye-catching, informative thumbnails that quickly convey the game's content and attract potential players.
